**NOTE:**
v1.0 can **NOT** calculate floats (0.5, 231.2, etc). It can if you are using v2.0+. You just add f in the front of each function. (eg. ffd (float divide because you can not write f in front of d (fd) cause that is already taken. fffd = float floor divide), fa (float addition), etc.
# The PythonCalculator Project
###### PythonCalculator is a app that is built with Python 3.9.4. It can be used in the latest version. You must have at least version 3.9.4.
To use **PythonCalculator**, open the terminal / command line.
If you are on a **terminal**, go to your desktop with `cd Desktop`. Now, clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/KiaWeb/PythonCalculator.git`. Now, run `cd PythonCalculator` and then type `python3 main.py`. Make sure your python is updated to 3.9.4!
If you are on a **CLI / Command Line (Windows cmd.exe)**, then download Git [here.](https://https://git-scm.com/downloads) Once you have downloaded Git, open __Git Bash__. Now type `cd Desktop` to go to your desktop. Now, clone this repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/KiaWeb/PythonCalculator.git` Now, exit __Git Bash__ and go in the PythonCalculator folder. Now, open a command line in that folder, and type `python main.py`! Now you can use the calculator.
If you are on **Windows**, simply download the 1.0 or 2.0 exe (1.0 is without floats). If you are on **Linux**, open Wine and download 1.0 or 2.0 exe and run with wine. If you are on **macOS**, download 1.0 or 2.0 exe and run with WineBottler or Darwine.
**IMPORTANT:**
To use this calculator, it will ask you for a, s, m, d, and fd.
**HOW TO USE:**
It asks for a, s, m, d, and fd. a means Addition, s means Subtraction, m means Multiply, d means Divide, and fd means Floor Divide.
You can type `a`, or `s`, or `m`, or `d`, or `fd` to do the operations.
Next, put the 1st number, then the 2nd number, and it will give the answer!
Wait 5 seconds to restart the app. It will automatically restart.
To close the app, close the **Terminal / Command Line**.
**What is floor divide?**
Floor Divide does division but without the remainder.
